# Windows Defender Scan Pipeline — Reverse Engineering Reference

A reverse engineering breakdown of the 13-stage scan pipeline inside **mpengine.dll** (v1.1.24120.x, 14.3 MB, PE32 x86) — the core engine DLL behind Windows Defender / Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Every file, script, and memory buffer scanned on a Windows machine flows through this single monolithic binary.

Each stage is documented with reconstructed data structures, pseudocode, address-level references, RTTI class hierarchies, and string table extractions from the binary itself.

## Pipeline Stages

The scan pipeline is sequential — each stage can produce detections, collect attributes for downstream stages, or recursively invoke the entire pipeline on extracted content.

| # | Stage | What It Does |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 00 | **Overview** | End-to-end map of the pipeline architecture, `ScanContext` / `ThreatRecord` data structures, and the `__rsignal` / `rsignal` export API |
| 01 | **Entry Point** | How `__rsignal` and `rsignal` receive scan commands, dispatch by command code, and initialize the `ScanContext` for execution |
| 02 | **Friendly File** | SHA-256/SHA-512 trusted-file whitelist lookup — files that match are immediately returned clean, short-circuiting the rest of the pipeline |
| 03 | **Static Engine Cascade** | 11 signature engines that fire in a fixed order over raw file bytes: STATIC, PEHSTR, PEHSTR_EXT, MACRO, KCRCE, BRUTE, NID, DBVAR, VDLL_SIG, ARHSTR, and MSILFLAG |
| 04 | **Attribute Collection** | Continuous collection of string-tag attributes into the scan context — fed into the AAGGREGATOR boolean evaluator at Stage 11 |
| 05 | **PE Emulation** | Full x86/x64/ARM CPU emulator embedded in the engine: 198 emulated Windows APIs, 973 virtual DLLs, FOP opcode tracing, and behavioral telemetry for dynamic unpacking |
| 06 | **Unpacked Content** | Recursive rescan of PE sections and files dropped by the emulator — feeds unpacked content back through the full pipeline |
| 07 | **Container Extraction** | Recursive extraction of child objects from archives, Office docs, PDFs, installers, and other containers via pluggable nUFS format handlers |
| 08 | **Script Deobfuscation** | NScript fixed-point deobfuscation engine for PowerShell, VBScript, JScript, and Batch — iteratively simplifies obfuscated scripts until stable |
| 09 | **BRUTE Matching** | Format-agnostic content matching over raw, unpacked, and deobfuscated buffers — catches patterns the format-specific engines miss |
| 10 | **Lua Scripts** | Lua 5.1 detection runtime executing rule sets through custom `mp.*` APIs — the most flexible detection layer in the engine |
| 11 | **Attribute Evaluation** | AAGGREGATOR boolean evaluation: combines all collected attributes via AND/OR/NOT logic trees to produce composite threat detections |
| 12 | **MAPS Cloud Lookup** | Cloud escalation to Microsoft MAPS for low-confidence local detections — includes FASTPATH quick-response and full sample submission |
| 13 | **Verdict Resolution** | Final stage: merges all detections, deduplicates, applies severity ranking, filters infrastructure markers, and returns the single highest-priority verdict |
